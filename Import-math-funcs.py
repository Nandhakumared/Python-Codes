import math as m
# Here we assigned math as m, so we can aslo use both m and math
# To use maths fucntions like sqrt, sin, cos etc. Import math fucntion.
#use math. before function.

'''Sqrt'''
# this will find squar root value
x = 9
print(math.sqrt(x))
print(m.sqrt(x))

'''Floor 7 Ceil'''
# this Floor and ceil fucntion is used round off the values.
# Floor will round down the value & Ceil will round up the value
y = 2.6
print(math.floor(y))
print(m.ceil(y))
